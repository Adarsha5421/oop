// Encapsulation in Dart: Explanation and Example
// Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming principle that restricts direct access to an object's data and behavior. It involves keeping sensitive data private within a class and exposing only what is necessary through public methods, typically using getters and setters.

// In Dart, we achieve encapsulation by:

// Marking instance variables as private using an underscore (_).
// Providing public getters and setters to control access to these variables.
