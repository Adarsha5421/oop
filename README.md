ðŸš€ Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. It is built on four fundamental pillars:
1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and ensures controlled access through getters and setters.

Purpose: Protect data integrity and hide implementation details.


2. Abstraction
Abstraction simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the system's level of interaction. It hides unnecessary details and shows only essential features.

Purpose: Reduce complexity and increase code clarity.


3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.

Purpose: Reuse existing code and establish a relationship between classes.

4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The same method behaves differently based on the object that invokes it.

Purpose: Enable flexibility and dynamic method invocation.

Conclusion:
Understanding these four pillars of OOPâ€”Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphismâ€”is crucial for writing clean, modular, and maintainable code. ðŸš€âœ¨
